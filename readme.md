This is a Minecraft mod that adds another type of levers. Instead of outputting a redstone signal from each side of the
lever block they only output signal from the short sides. On the long sides, they accept redstone input - and they get
toggled when they receive such a signal.

This is inspired by the SCM mod made by amadornes, where tiny levers on circuits have similar behavior.
